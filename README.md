TeleinHTTP
==========

Teleinfo Serial to HTTP made simple.

Purpose
-------

This script was created to allow getting teleinformation value to Home Automation systems such as [OpenHab] without having to write a Java/whatever Binding; using the quite common HTTP Binding instead.

Arbitrary Choices
-----------------

The used port by this script is 8353. This is how you would write "tele" on your cell-phone.

Using this tool
---------------

This is as simple as HTTP Get, [http://localhost:8353/PAPP] will return the value for PAPP.

Contributing ?
--------------

Feel free to contribute, submit bugs and even better the fixes on GitHUB, that's the whole point of open source.
